## About
**TICON** is an Android application that allows the user to shop emoticons on their android device. Emoticon is a word from emotion+icon and are icons/images that the user can send on chatting screen to express their emotions or reactions. The software is written in Java along with xml files on Android Studio to create the user interface and provide basic functionality as a shopping app. This is connected to cloud firestore to control data of items and update live as the user interacts with the items on the application. However, currently there is a limitation to number of emoticons in database and also the later steps of shopping such as purchasing and using emoticons in other android chatting application is not implemented yet.
